                    This encompasses the potential for losses due to technology failures or obsolete technologies. It means ensuring your chosen technologies are scalable, in case you want to expand their use, ensuring they’re compatible with existing systems and that they work in the way they should.

                <li>Cyber</li>
                Firms need to protect their digital assets from unauthorized access/usage. Confidentiality needs to be assured.

                <p>Strategic risks can include external forces that require a change in the organization’s direction. This may impact its investment in new technologies and can also affect brand value and reputation.

            <h3>Digital Tech world</h3>
            <p>Digital technology is increasingly making machines smarter. In some cases, the machines no longer need humans to operate them, freeing up workers from often boring tasks for more interesting pursuits. In other cases, smarter machines mean better standards of safety, or a better experience for the user. Products and services drop in price as the technology develops and becomes more common. Many tasks can now be done directly by customers, rather than having to be done through another person acting as an intermediary, for instance, booking a holiday.</p>

            <h3>GDPR/Online Security</h3>
            <p>Data breaches are increasingly making weekly headlines of national newspapers. Whether a breach is accidental or malicious in nature, performed by an insider or an external attacker, it is the loss of data which causes the reputational and often large financial impact to the business. Organisations have for a long time been playing catch-up in regard to data security and protection. Due to a number of high profile data breaches, industry regulation is increasing its focus on ensuring organisations have in place appropriate protection for personal data.</p>
            <p>Under the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) adopted on 27th April 2016 ( enforceable 25th May 2018) organisations handling EU data subjects can now be expected to be fined up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is the greater. They must also only maintain data as long as necessary, and identify all affected individuals within 72 hours in the event of a breach. The UK ICO is now also seeking to align UK legislation and penalties against the regulation. This represents a challenge for organisations without visibility and control of the type of data they handle, where the data is located and applicable regulations.</p>
            <p>The UK’s decision to leave the UK, or ‘Brexit’ has introduced uncertainty about GDPR, however the ICO has made it certain the UK will enact into UK Law either exactly as the GDPR and may make additional requirements. This is because to trade with Counties of the the EU will require compliance with GDPR as the minimum.</p>
            <p>Now is the time to implement appropriate data security measures to locate, identify and protect sensitive business and personal data within your organisation, enabling compliance with applicable legislation such as the EU GDPR and UK DPA (Data Protection Act). Every organisation is different. Our approach is to tailor the solution for you to meet GDPR with comfortable changes to your established processes. We do not shoe-horn you into a proprietary solution that might not fit well with your business or culture.

    <div class="critic-review">
        <p>
            As students, we have great room for improvement and one of the best ingredients for growing is honest feedback. Good feedback/critic review has a great way of shaping us into better versions of ourselves.
            <br> I've gotten a lot of good information by learning how to use resources like: Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello. For instance Trello makes you focused to create your own plan. What is it that you're trying to apply to your website from what you have learned in classes. This way I was capable to grab pieces from everywhere that I needed and put together my own plan that's superior to any because I don't expect anyone to do it for me.
            <br> I believe this tools together with our critic review of our work gives us the mindset of constantly trying and it's really, really rewarding if you get it right.
            <br> I have learned by creating little bits of code and I failed and improved until it passed the test. I used Stack Overflow, w3schools website, MDN Developer Mozilla, Youtube Html, CSS and Javascript tutorials.
            <br> What it is beautiful about constant reading and learning is that every time you think you have a good handle on a topic, you stumble across a rabbit trail that you didn't explored it yet. The longer and harder I studied, the more the topic seemed to expand in all directions. As frustrating as it sounds it proved to be the best way to learn and to do it in a fast pace. It really caught me off guard but the faster I learned the more I retained.
            <br> I didn't charge my brain anymore with trivial details and instead I zeroed it on the key concepts-then applied the knowledge into the website, locking it at the same time into my long-term memory. This critic review together with the feedback from the trainers and collegues helps me reverse-engineer and systematize what I sometimes was doing by instinct. I went from being overwhelmed and intimidated by the new domain I was tackling to confidence that I understand the breadth and scope of each topic.
